# Exam 70-768: Developing SQL Data Models

This is the first part of certification: **MCSA: SQL 2016 BI Development**. It could be a good way to apprrove your ability to write advanced, highly optimized SQL queries to retrieve large volume data. Comparing to it's precedemt exam **70-461: Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2012** , the exam 70-768 has cutted a large part of the content that is too complext and unlikely to be used by most DA or BA. Therefore, pass exam 70-768 will be relatively easier.
