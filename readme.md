# Exam 70-768: Developing SQL Data Models

This is the first part of certification: **MCSA: SQL 2016 BI Development**. It could be a good way to apprrove your ability to write advanced, highly optimized SQL queries to retrieve large volume data. Comparing to it's precedemt exam **70-461: Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2012** , the exam 70-768 has cutted a large part of the content that is too complext and unlikely to be used by most DA or BA. Therefore, pass exam 70-768 will be relatively easier.

a. What is SQL?
   - **SQL** (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific **language** used in programming and designed for **managing data held in a relational database**
   
   - **SQL** is also a **standard** of both the **International Organization for Standards (IOS)** and the **American National Standards Institute (ANSI)**. In the other words, these two standards will not create conflicts or errors with SQL.
   
   - All leading database vendors, e.g. Microsoft and Oracle, implement a dialect of SQL as the main language to manage and manipulate data in the database platforms. Therefore, the core language elementsare the same (Trandard SQL).
